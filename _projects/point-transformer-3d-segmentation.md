title: 3D Point Cloud Segmentation using Point-Transformer
layout: project 
year: experiment replication
project-url: https://github.com/Zeyad-Abdelreheem/Awesome-3D-Vision-Notebooks/blob/main/point_transformer.ipynb
excerpt: Re-implemented the experiments done in this paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09164). The authors used a new architecture called Point Transformer to classify each point in the point cloud set to a specific class (semantic segmentation). They used it for other tasks as classification and part segmentation but I was interested in the semantic segmentation task only.
